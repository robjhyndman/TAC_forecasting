# TACforecasting 

This package provides functions to help with forecasting attendant care hours for the Transport Accident Commission.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# First install the dependencies
install.packages(c("tsibble","fabletools","abind","distributional","dplyr",
	"forcats","forecast","furrr","ggplot2","hts","janitor","lubridate",
  "MASS","readr","stringr","tibble","tidyr","tsbox","remotes"))
# Then install this package
remotes::install_github("robjhyndman/TACforecasting")
```

## Example

The data included in the package and in this example has been randomly generated. No real data is included in this repository.

```{r}
library(TACforecasting)
library(ggplot2)
```

```r
# Read data
group_costs <- read_tac_data(
  claims_file = "data-raw/T086_claim_header.csv",
  costs_file = "data-raw/T086_attendant_care_hours.csv"
)
```

```{r}
# Plot total hours by billing period
plot_total_hours(group_costs)

# Plot total hours per age group by billing period
plot_total_hours(group_costs, age_group, include_average = FALSE) +
   ggtitle("Hours by age group in each billing period")

# Plot total hours per injury group by billing period
plot_total_hours(group_costs, injury_group, include_average = FALSE) +
   ggtitle("Hours by injury group in each billing period")

# Number of billing periods to forecast. Needs to be > 1
h <- 13
# Number of futures to simulate for each model
nsim <- 200

# Compute forecasts of total hours by age group and injury group
fable_forecasts_hours <- get_forecasts(group_costs, h, nsim)
```

```{r}
# Plot forecasts of total hours
plot_forecasts(fable_forecasts_hours, group_costs)

# Plot forecasts of total hours by age group
plot_forecasts(fable_forecasts_hours, group_costs, show_age_group = "20-34") +
   ggtitle("Forecasts of total hours for 20-34 year olds")

# Plot forecasts of total hours by injury group
plot_forecasts(fable_forecasts_hours, group_costs, show_injury_group = "NONCAT") +
   ggtitle("Forecasts of total hours from NONCAT injuries claims")
```
